This is a convenient language bundle for the Emacs package [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter][tree-sitter]]. It serves as an interim distribution mechanism, until ~tree-sitter~ is widespread enough for language-specific major modes to incorporate its functionalities.

For each supported language, this package provides:
1. Pre-compiled grammar binaries for 3 major platforms: macOS, Linux and Windows, on x86_64. In the future, ~tree-sitter-langs~ may provide tooling for major modes to do this on their own.
2. An optional ~highlights.scm~ file that provides highlighting patterns. This is mainly intended for major modes that are not aware of ~tree-sitter~. A language major mode that wants to use ~tree-sitter~ for syntax highlighting should instead provide the query patterns on its own, using the mechanisms defined by [[https://ubolonton.github.io/emacs-tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting/interface-for-modes/][tree-sitter-hl]].
3. Optional query patterns for other minor modes that provide high-level functionalities on top of ~tree-sitter~, such as code folding, evil text objects... As with highlighting patterns, major modes that are directly aware of ~tree-sitter~ should provide the query patterns on their own.

** Building grammars from source
It's more convenient to work with this repository as a submodule of [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter#building-grammars-from-source][emacs-tree-sitter]]. However, if you want to skip that, below are the steps to build grammars from source using only this repository.

*** Tools and dependencies
- Install [[https://cask.readthedocs.io][cask]].
- Install NodeJS. It is needed to generate the grammar code from the JavaScript DSL. The recommended tool to manage NodeJS is [[https://volta.sh/][volta]].
- Install [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#installation][tree-sitter CLI tool]]. (Its binary can also be downloaded directly from [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases][GitHub]].) *Note: versions 0.20+ cannot be used, as they introduce [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/1157][a breaking change]] in binary storage location*.

*** Building a single grammar
Run ~script/compile <lang>~, where ~lang~ is one of the languages under [[./repos][repos/]].
#+begin_src bash
  script/compile rust
#+end_src

*** Building the whole grammar bundle
#+begin_src bash
  script/compile all
#+end_src
